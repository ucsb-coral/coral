# About Me

Hello everyone. I am James, a 3rd year Computer Science student. I currently do not have a specific focus on what specialty I am interested in, but I am very excited to learn new things and figure that out.

There is a project I have always wanted to make, and have communicated with various correlated parties about, which is a better version of Shoreline. I find the event filtering very unintuitive, and its difficult for users to get specific recommendations about exactly what they should do. I look forward to improving that problem and integrating a solution into the existing mobile app that we have.
