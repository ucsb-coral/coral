## Retro Assessment

- Used Start/Stop/Continue outline for retro
- Went decently well. Some long-standing conflicts have been brought up and discussed. We have not quite reached a resolution on these issues, but we are glad that we are able to have a conversation about it.
- Advice for next person: plan the retro in advance and have an agenda about specific topics that people have contributed. Unless the issues is very pressing, try to only facilitate the conversation instead of jumping in with opinions. The discussion that happened at retro today may be an exception to this rule.

## Experiments

- Experiment: Scheduling pair programming work sessions to see if it works well
- Assessment: James and Thomas did pair programming in spare time using the VS Code live share feature, were able to push several features successfully with massively decreased learning curve and error rate. Also make working on the project more enjoyable.
- Decision: pair programming should be incorporated as a suggested method of working on project code. Teammate should see to meet up offline and program together in order to increase productivity.
