# Date of Retrospective: 11/15/23

* Led by: Jinghan Zhang
* Present: All
* Absent: None

## Action item

* a goal: Implement remaining MVP targets and resolve useful ideas from MVP feedback
* a change: We need to work on coordinating individual tasks so the end product is organized (i.e. styling)
* a measurement: How uniform our styling is, number of major merge conflicts, how much we need to go back and tweak finished features to be in line with other features.


## Retro Experiment 
* Outcome: We've discussed about keeping consistent styling, and have come up with some ways to solve this: modularization, more strict reviews. But, since the experiment duration was short, we haven't seen the full results yet. Our experiment is TBD.
