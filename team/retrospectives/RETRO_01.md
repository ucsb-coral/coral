# Date of Retrospective: 1/26/24

* Led by: Daniel Lu
* Present: Arnav Kumar(zoom), Daniel Lu, Ethan Pletcher, James Fu, Thomas Hale, Scott Graham
* Absent: Konark Vinod

## Start

* Actually coding
* Discipline/follow agendas/structures (back and forth on importance of structure vs creative freedom) with a conclusion that there needs to be a balance between when a meeting is declared that focus and attention be required in order to wrap up that meeting without it being a waste of time. All while allowing the team the freedom to work freely once the meeting is over.
* streamline this process and keep side comments for afterwards (for non retro meetings)
* Attendance has been an issue. If self accountability is an issue then we will have to get core staff involved.
* divy up tasks
* (Later edit by Konark Vinod) setting up Android dev environment
## Stop
* side tracking and distractions	
* (Later edit by Konark Vinod)Notifying team about absences late
## Continue
* respect/good friendly vibes/ no hard feelings
##  Shoutouts:
* James - Team batman. Behind the scenes always making it happen and is not the hero we deserve but certainly the one we need.
* Ethan - Helping everyone with setting up there environments
* Scott - Efforts in keeping team on task


## 02/02 LAB_03 Experiment 
We now have group buy in with regards to our standup meetings and efficiency has made a giant leap. In general meetings are more regulated and policed by all members. Distractions are caught and moved to the sidebar after the meeting.
