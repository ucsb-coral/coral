# User Feedback Needs

- The Dining Commons page, Events page, and the functionality to add to your Google Calendar to are the features we are focusing on this quarter. How is the overall experience of these features? Is there anything that bothers / annoys you?
- Currently, the classes and login page is made with custom UI elements, and the events page is make using react native paper following the MaterialUI style. Which style do you prefer? We apologize for this inconsistency, but we are intentionally leaving it in this stage to gauge user preference.
- What other additional features or changes would you want to see for you to actually use this app so that it could provide value ot you?
