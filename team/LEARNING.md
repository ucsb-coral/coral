## Learning:
Here's where we'll keep a living document of technologies that we're learning.
With each item discuss how as a team we will learn necessary skills
* We are inheriting a tech stack from Ethan's previous class, the rest of the class doesn't know the stack well. He will be giving a crash course on react and ruby.
* Online resources are standard operating proceedure for "immediate action"
* Some sources such as ChatGPT will not be heavily leaned upon except for further elaboration and explaination of topics found through other means.
