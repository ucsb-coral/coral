# Sprint 01

## Deliverables

### Set up development environment

At the end of setting up the development environment, everyone should have installed all the dependencies necessary to be able to build and simulate the existing coral app on their development device without any issues.
OS depending, this may involve setting up:

- Ruby
- Android studio / XCode with respective simulators
- CocoaPod
- NodeJS
- Yarn

After successfully setting up, the developers should be able to launch an instance of the app on their respective devices, log into their personal accounts, and view their schedule. More experienced team members should assist less experienced team members after they themselves are done setting up.

### Learn more about React Native

Given this React Native is a rather unfamiliar tech-stack for everyone, and it may take different amounts of time for people to get set up on the development environment due to individual circumstances regarding the initial conditions of their computers, we have decided not to commit to more hard deliverables for this sprint, which only lasts a week. Instead, for those who are done with setup before the end of the sprint, we would like to encourage them to use the extra time play around with the elements of React Native and learn more about the style and syntax involved in React Native development.
