# Problem Scenario

Alex, a busy UCSB student, often finds themselves with free time in the afternoons and wants to make the most of it by attending interesting events on or near campus. However, existing event apps such as Shoreline are not user-friendly or tailored to the specific needs of university students seeking local events and social activities. Alex wishes to have a student utility app that can quickly provide information about events taking place in the next few days that fit his individual schedule, allowing them to make spontaneous plans.
