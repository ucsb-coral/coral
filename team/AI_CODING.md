# AI Code

## Scott - V0.dev and Google Gemini

I'm exploring using V0 for page design. This is something that I have never cared much for so learning about this AI service really piqued my interest. I'm looking to replace the button options I have previously implemented and following the guidance of the feedback from the MVP correct our UI.  
I then take the code from V0 and feed it into google gemini to change it from react into react-native.
I'm finding that this is no one stop shop but it can facilitate efficiency if utilized correctly. I find this is the case with all AI in software.
I think I will be using this in any case possible moving forward.
I will be implementing various elements on my own that will be integrated into the output of the two AI's.

## James - Microsoft Copilot

Given Microsoft Co-Pilot basically gives GPT-4 for free, I am using it to learn more about react native, which I did not have prior exposure to React Native development. I have been pasting in code snippets and have the AI explain what the code does to me,it has relaly taught me quite a lot. I have not year started using it for writing code / development, only for learning. However, if I were to implement AI code in my programs, I would make sure to include unit test for those segments of code as well to maek sure that it's reliable.
