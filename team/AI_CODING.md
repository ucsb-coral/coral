## AI Code

# Scott - V0.dev and Google Gemini
I'm exploring using V0 for page design. This is something that I have never cared much for so learning about this AI service really piqued my interest. I'm looking to replace the button options I have previously implemented and following the guidance of the feedback from the MVP correct our UI.  
I then take the code from V0 and feed it into google gemini to change it from react into react-native.
I'm finding that this is no one stop shop but it can facilitate efficiency if utilized correctly. I find this is the case with all AI in software. 
I think I will be using this in any case possible moving forward. 
I will be implementing various elements on my own that will be integrated into the output of the two AI's. 

# Ethan - Amazon Codewhisperer, Github Copilot and Google Gemini
I use Codewhisperer and Copilot for code suggestions and documentation generation.
Recently, I signed up for a free trial for Gemini Advanced and have been experimenting with code generation.
It seems to do a pretty good job, but it's definitely not perfect.

# Thomas - ChatGPT
I'm very used to just straight up asking ChatGPT for coding help, so that's what I've also been doing for this project. For example, when I was trying to figure out how to get scroll functionality done, as well as how to integrate specific objects into said scroll, ChatGPT helped a lot there. IE, I asked ChatGPT how to use FlatList with an already existing component that we cooked up. Also, I've just been using ChatGPT in general to understand what other people are doing, as well as for learning more and more features of javascript and/or react. Me and another team member were also using ChatGPT to figure out a cost-effective way of processing user-submitted images in our app.
