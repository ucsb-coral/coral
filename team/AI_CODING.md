## AI Code

# Scott - V0.dev and Google Gemini
I'm exploring using V0 for page design. This is something that I have never cared much for so learning about this AI service really piqued my interest. I'm looking to replace the button options I have previously implemented and following the guidance of the feedback from the MVP correct our UI.  
I then take the code from V0 and feed it into google gemini to change it from react into react-native.
I'm finding that this is no one stop shop but it can facilitate efficiency if utilized correctly. I find this is the case with all AI in software. 
I think I will be using this in any case possible moving forward. 
I will be implementing various elements on my own that will be integrated into the output of the two AI's. 

# Ethan - Amazon Codewhisperer, Github Copilot and Google Gemini
I use Codewhisperer and Copilot for code suggestions and documentation generation.
Recently, I signed up for a free trial for Gemini Advanced and have been experimenting with code generation.
It seems to do a pretty good job, but it's definitely not perfect.
