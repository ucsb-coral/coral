# CS148 Project Development Norms

## Introduction

Welcome to the NORMS.md file for our CS148 project. This document serves as a guide and agreement for our team's behavior, collaboration, and communication standards throughout the project. It is intended to foster a respectful, inclusive, and productive environment.

## Communication Norms

- Respectful Language: Always use respectful and professional language in all forms of communication, whether in-person, over video calls, or in written formats like emails and chat messages.
- Responsiveness: Aim to respond to messages and emails within 24 hours during weekdays. If a longer response time is needed, notify the team.
Regular Meetings: Hold regular meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps. The frequency and schedule of these meetings will be agreed upon by the team.

## Collaboration Norms

- Inclusivity: Every team member’s ideas and contributions are valuable. We commit to ensuring everyone feels heard and respected.
- Decision Making: Decisions should be made collaboratively. When consensus cannot be reached, we will default to a majority vote.
- Peer Review: All code contributions must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging to ensure quality and consistency.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Code Standards: Adhere to the coding standards and best practices as taught in CS148. This includes proper documentation and code structure.
- Use of Version Control (Git): Regularly commit changes to our repository and use descriptive commit messages. Follow the agreed-upon branching and merging strategies.
- Issue Tracking: Utilize issue tracking tools to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Each team member is responsible for updating the status of their tasks.
- Skill Development and Support
- Mentorship: More experienced members are encouraged to mentor others. Sharing knowledge and skills strengthens our team.
- Asking for Help: Never hesitate to ask for help. If you’re struggling with something, reach out to a team member or the instructor.

## Enforcement

- Accountability: Each member is accountable for adhering to these norms. Failure to do so may result in a discussion with the team and, if necessary, escalation to the course instructor.
- Revisiting Norms: These norms are not set in stone. We will revisit and revise them as needed to ensure they serve the team's best interest.

## Agreement

- By participating in this project, you agree to abide by these norms and contribute to a positive and productive environment.
