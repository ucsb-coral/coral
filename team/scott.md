# About Me

## Personal Intro

## Project Ideas and Vision

- I originally submitted the gym traffic service idea.
But more focused on this app.
- Utility-Balanced Application Design-I am a proponent of designing applications that strike a perfect balance between offering extensive utility and maintaining user-friendliness. My goal is to create applications that are both powerful and intuitive, avoiding any overwhelming complexity for the user.
- Long-Term Vision for Web Services: While the idea is still in its nascent stages, I envision the potential expansion of our project into a widely accessible web service. I believe that if our service proves to be genuinely useful, offering it as a web service could significantly broaden its impact and reach. That's if we truly find that our service could be truly adopted and used regularly.
