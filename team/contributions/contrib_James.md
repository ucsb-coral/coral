# James' Contributions

This quarter, I mainly focused on the events feature of the app, as it is my original project idea, just in a mobile app form.

I mainly pair-programmed with Thomas to implement and improve the initial front end and back end of the events tab. We worked on getting documents from the UCSB Events API, parsing the correct information out of them, and explored using React Native Paperto to orient our front-end style, which the rest of the team followed to implement on the rest of the app.

Later, I implemented some bug fixes independently, and implemented the add events to calendar feature with some help from Ethan.

Lastly, I led every scrum meeting that happened in the quarter and scribed every retro. I also did my part in writing a lot of team documentations.
