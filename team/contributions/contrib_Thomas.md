# Thomas' Contributions

This quarter, I mainly focused on the events feature of the app, including the UI and functional components

I set up the initial events page, and pair-programmed with James on pretty much everything in events beyond the calendar integration. We worked on getting documents from the UCSB Events API, extracted the events information out of them, and explored using react-native-paper together, which we then encouraged the rest of the team to use (and which in my opinion looks quite nice). 

I also did some basic events refactoring, and did a smaller bit of the server stuff than James alongside him.

I also created the meat of the slides and helped direct the others into adding on top of that and creating a great presentation in the end.
