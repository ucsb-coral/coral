# About Me

This is Daniel here! I am a 4th year Computer Science BS/MS student. I'm looking forward to adding the favorite dining commons notification reminder feature to this app! I like to play games with friends and play music. I'm also in the UCSB Middle Eastern Ensemble and I'm trying to start a cover rock band!
