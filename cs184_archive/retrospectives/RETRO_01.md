# Date of Retrospective: 10/20/23

* Led by: Ethan Pletcher
* Present: All
* Absent: None

## Action item

* a goal: Get ahead of the group deliverables and get meaningful work done on our MVP.
* a change: We need to get better at assigning indevidual work on the deliverables for the project itself, since most of our group time is dedicated to getting through the Canvas assignment overhead, maybe think about due dates and implimenting better communication methods for coordinating work.
* a measurement: The speed with which we are able to move through user stories and reach deliverables on our Kanban board.

## Optional

* 

## Retro Assessment

* In leading this retro, I followed the template given in the assignment details page on Canvas
* It went very well. We had similar ideas about what our group needed to do to improve and what are nexts steps were as a team. I think it was helpful to air some of the factors that were getting in the way of the project.
* I would way to just think about the issues your group is having in getting work done efficiently, and try to think of ways to collaboratively brainstorm ways to solve them.

## Retro Experiment 
* Outcome: We improved a little in assigning individual work, but we are still stuck with doing class assignments. We also haven't gotten much of a codebase yet, so it's harder to split up work. Since the start of the sprint, our throughput of issues from TODO to DONE has been low, with only ~2 issues, but we have split up larger issues into smaller tasks to improve this. Although the experiment was a failure, we should try to continue incorporating the experiment's practices in our workflow.
