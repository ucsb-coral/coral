* It went very well. we same idea on how and what to do with the product 
* Taking care of others and get the work done on time 

## Retro Experiment 
* Outcome: We've discussed about keeping consistent styling, and have come up with some ways to solve this: modularization, more strict reviews. But, since the experiment duration was short, we haven't seen the full results yet. Our experiment is TBD.
