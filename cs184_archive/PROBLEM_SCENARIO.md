# Problem Scenario

 - **Problem 1**: Students often have difficulty managing their time and keeping track of their schedules. So we need to have a button to manually update the schedule.

 - **Problem 2**: UCSB students frequently collaborate on group projects or participate in group study sessions, and coordinating these activities can be challenging. They often face difficulties in finding a convenient time for everyone and managing the group discussions effectively.

 - **Problem 3**: In group chats, students sometimes encounter issues such as disagreements, inappropriate behavior, or non-participatory members. These issues can disrupt the flow of communication and collaboration within the group.
